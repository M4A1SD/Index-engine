as
all

13
however
an
earlier
definition
proposed
by
jacques
gauthier
gained
wide
currency
in
the
21st
century
and
is
used
by
many
scientists
including
adherents
to
the
phylocode
gauthier
defined
aves
to
include
only
the
crown
group
of
the
set
of
modern
birds
this
was
done
by
excluding
most
groups
known
only
from
fossils
and
assigning
them
instead
to
the
broader
group
avialae
14
on
the
principle
that
a
clade
based
on
extant
species
should
be
limited
to
those
extant
species
and
their
closest
extinct
relatives
14
gauthier
and
de
queiroz
identified
four
different
definitions
for
the
same
biological
name
aves
which
is
a
problem
15
the
authors
proposed
to
reserve
the
term
aves
only
for
the
crown
group
consisting
of
the
last
common
ancestor
of
all
living
birds
and
all
of
its
descendants

have
been
adopted
by

in

though
the
exact

applied
have
been
inconsistent

most
researchers
define

as

clade
though
definitions
vary
many
authors
have
used

closer

with

avialae
is
also
occasionally
defined
as
an
apomorphy
based
clade
that
is
one
based
on
physical
characteristics
jacques
gauthier
who
named
avialae
in
1986
re
defined
it
in
2001
as
all
dinosaurs
that
possessed
feathered
wings
used
in
flapping
flight
and
the
birds
that
descended
from
them
15
21
despite
being
currently
one
of
the
most
widely
used
the
crown
group
definition
of
aves
has
been
criticised
by
some
researchers
lee
and
spencer
1997
argued
that
contrary
to
what
gauthier
defended
this
definition
would
not
increase
the
stability
of
the
clade
and
the
exact
content
of
aves
will
always
be
uncertain
because
any
defined
clade
either
crown
or
not
will
have
few
synapomorphies
distinguishing
it
from
its
closest
relatives

alternative

24
based
on

evidence
most
scientists
accept
that
birds
are
a
specialised
subgroup
of
theropod
dinosaurs
25
and
more
specifically
members
of
maniraptora
a
group
of
theropods
which
includes
dromaeosaurids
and
oviraptorosaurs
among
others
26
as
scientists
have
discovered
more
theropods
closely
related
to
birds
the
previously
clear
distinction
between
non
birds
and
birds
has
become
blurred
by
the
2000s
discoveries
in
the
liaoning
province
of
northeast
china
which
demonstrated
many
small
theropod
feathered
dinosaurs
contributed

anchiornis

is
an
important
source
of
information
on
the
early
evolution
of
birds
in
the
late
jurassic
period
30
the
consensus
view
in
contemporary
palaeontology
is
that
the
flying
theropods
or
avialans
are
the
closest
relatives
of
the
deinonychosaurs
which
include
dromaeosaurids
and
troodontids
31
together
these
form
a
group
called
paraves
some
basal
members
of
deinonychosauria
such
as
microraptor
have
features
which
may
have
enabled
them
to
glide
or
fly
the
most
basal
deinonychosaurs
were
very
small
this
evidence
raises
the
possibility
that
the
ancestor
of
all
paravians
may
have
been
arboreal
have
been
able
to
glide
or
both
32
33
unlike
archaeopteryx
and
the
non
avialan
feathered
dinosaurs
who
primarily
ate
meat
studies
suggest
that
the
first
avialans
were
omnivores
34
the
late
jurassic
archaeopteryx
is
well
known
as
one
of
the
first
transitional
fossils
to
be
found
and
it
provided
support
for
the
theory
of
evolution
in
the
late
19th
century
archaeopteryx
was
the
first
fossil
to
display
both
clearly
traditional
reptilian
characteristics
teeth
clawed
fingers
and
a
long
lizard
like
tail
as
well
as
wings
with
flight
feathers
similar
to
those
of
modern
birds
it
is
not
considered

ancestor
of
birds

it
is
possibly
closely
related
to
the
true
ancestor

in

a

modern

would
have
expanded

the

was

via

and

7
on

hand
the

even
these

97
it
has
been
speculated
that
this

an
adaptation
to

males
have
two

also
terrestrial
birds
generally
have

explanation
is
that
the
egg
develops
a
shell
while
passing
through
the

over
a
period
of
about
a

so
that
if

most
complex
respiratory
systems
of
all
animal
groups
78
upon
inhalation
75
of
the
fresh
air
bypasses
the
lungs
and
flows
directly
into
a
posterior
air
sac
which
extends
from
the
lungs
and
connects
with
air
spaces
in
the
bones
and
fills
them
with
air
the
other
25
of
the
air
goes
directly
into
the
lungs
when
the
bird
exhales
the
used
air
flows
out
of
the
lungs
and
the
stored
fresh
air
from
the
posterior
air
sac
is
simultaneously
forced
into
the
lungs
thus
a
bird
s
lungs
receive
a
constant
supply
of
fresh
air
during
both
inhalation
and
exhalation
105

heart
type
and
features
didactic
model
of
an
avian
heart
the
avian
circulatory
system
is
driven
by
a
four
chambered
myogenic
heart
contained
in
a
fibrous
pericardial
sac
this
pericardial
sac
is
filled
with
a
serous
fluid
for
lubrication
109
the
heart
itself
is
divided
into
a
right
and
left
half
each
with
an
atrium
and
ventricle
the
atrium
and
ventricles
of
each
side
are
separated
by
atrioventricular
valves
which
prevent
back
flow
from
one
chamber
to
the
next
during
contraction
being
myogenic
the
heart
s
pace
is
maintained
by
pacemaker
cells
found
in
the
sinoatrial
node
located
on
the
right
atrium
110
the
sinoatrial
node
uses
calcium
to
cause
a
depolarising
signal
transduction
pathway
from
the
atrium
through
right
and
left
atrioventricular
bundle
which
communicates
contraction
to
the
ventricles
the
avian
heart
also
consists
of
muscular
arches
that
are
made
up
of
thick
bundles
of
muscular
layers
much
like
a
mammalian
heart
the
avian
heart
is
composed
of
endocardial
myocardial
and
epicardial
layers
109
the
atrium
walls
tend
to
be
thinner
than
the
ventricle
walls
due
to
the
intense
ventricular
contraction
used
to
pump
oxygenated
blood
throughout
the
body
avian
hearts
are
generally
larger
than
mammalian
hearts
when
compared
to
body
mass
this
adaptation
allows
more
blood
to
be
pumped
to
meet

birds
have
a
ten
times
greater

as
a
result
birds
have
more
blood

111
the

are
composed
of
thick
elastic
muscles
to
withstand
the
pressure
of
the
ventricular
contractions
and
become
more
rigid
as
they
move
away
from
the
heart
blood
moves
through
the
arteries
which
undergo
vasoconstriction
and
into
arterioles
which
act
as
a
transportation
system
to
distribute
primarily
oxygen
as
well
as
nutrients
to
all
tissues
of
the
body
as
the
arterioles
move
away
from
the
heart
and
into
individual
organs
and
tissues
they
are
further
divided
to
increase
surface
area
and
slow
blood
flow
blood
travels
through
the
arterioles
and
moves
into
the
capillaries
where
gas
exchange
can
occur
112
capillaries
are
organised
into
capillary
beds
in
tissues
it
is
here
that
blood
exchanges
oxygen
for
carbon
dioxide
waste
in
the
capillary
beds
blood
flow
is
slowed
to
allow
maximum
diffusion
of
oxygen
into
the
tissues
once
the
blood
has
become
deoxygenated
it
travels
through
venules
then
veins
and
back
to
the
heart
veins
unlike
arteries
are
thin
and
rigid
as
they
do
not
need
to
withstand
extreme
pressure
as
blood
travels
through
the
venules
to
the
veins
a
funneling
occurs
called
vasodilation
bringing
blood
back
to
the
heart
112
once
the
blood
reaches
the
heart
it
moves
first
into
the
right
atrium
then
the

ventricle
to
be
pumped
through
the

are
mutualistic
like
the

280
have
benefited
from
human

examples
include
the
sarus
crane
that
begins
nesting
in

when
farmers
flood
the

have
become
commercially
significant
agricultural

285
and
predation
by

such
as
psittacosis
salmonellosis
campylobacteriosis
mycobacteriosis
avian

of
cormorants
by

attraction
domesticated
birds
raised
for
meat
and
eggs
called
poultry
are
the
largest
source
of
animal
protein
eaten
by
humans
in
2003
76
million
tons
of
poultry
and
61
million
tons
of

were
produced
worldwide
288
chickens
account
for
much
of
human
poultry
consumption
though
domesticated
turkeys
ducks
and
geese
are
also
relatively
common
289
many
species
of
birds
are
also
hunted
for
meat
bird
hunting
is
primarily
a
recreational
activity
except
in
extremely
undeveloped
areas
the
most
important
birds
hunted
in
north
and
south
america
are
waterfowl
other
widely
hunted
birds
include
pheasants
wild
turkeys
quail
doves
partridge
grouse
snipe
and
woodcock
citation

muttonbirding
is
also
popular
in
australia
and
new
zealand
290
although
some
hunting
such
as
that
of
muttonbirds
may
be
sustainable
hunting
has
led
to
the
extinction
or
endangerment
of
dozens
of
species
291
other
commercially
valuable
products
from
birds
include
feathers
especially
the
down
of

and
ducks
which
are
used
as
insulation
in
clothing
and
bedding
and

birds
have
been
domesticated
by
humans
both
as
pets
and
for
practical
purposes
colourful
birds
such
as
parrots
and
mynas
are
bred
in
captivity
or
kept
as
pets
a
practice
that
has
led
to
the
illegal
trafficking
of
some
endangered
species
293
falcons
and
cormorants
have
long
been
used
for
hunting
and
fishing
respectively
messenger

295
many
homeowners
erect
bird
feeders
near
their
homes
to
attract
various
species
bird
feeding
has
grown
into
a
multimillion
dollar
industry
for
example
an
estimated
75
of
households
in
britain
provide
food
for
birds
at
some
point
during
the
winter

birds
play
prominent
and
diverse
roles
in
religion
and
mythology
in
religion
birds
may
serve
as
either
messengers
or
priests
and
leaders
for
a
deity
such
as
in
the
cult
of
makemake
in
which
the
tangata
manu
of
easter
island
served
as
chiefs
297
or
as
attendants
as
in
the
case
of
hugin
and
munin
the
two
common
ravens
who
whispered
news
into
the
ears
of
the
norse
god
odin
in
several
civilisations
of
ancient
italy
particularly
etruscan
and
roman
religion
priests
were
involved
in
augury
or
interpreting
the
words
of
birds
while
the
auspex
from
which
the
word
auspicious
is
derived
watched
their
activities
to
foretell
events
298
they
may
also
serve
as
religious
symbols
as
when
jonah
hebrew
יונה
dove
embodied
the
fright
passivity
mourning
and
beauty
traditionally
associated
with
doves
299
birds
have
themselves
been
deified
as
in
the
case
of
the
common
peacock
which
is
perceived
as
mother
earth
by
the
people
of
southern
india
300
in
the
ancient

doves
were
used
as
symbols
of

314
with
the

of
these
bird
artists
was
john
james
audubon
whose
paintings

an
erotic
symbol
in
his
catullus

groups
work
to
protect
birds
either
by
passing
laws
that
preserve

restore
bird
habitat
or
by
establishing
captive
populations
for
reintroductions
such
projects
have
produced
some
successes
one
study
estimated
that
conservation
efforts
saved
16
species
of
bird
that
would
otherwise
have
gone
extinct
between
1994
and
2004
including

species
such
as
the

and
european
starling
in
the
tropics
and
sub

relatively
more
